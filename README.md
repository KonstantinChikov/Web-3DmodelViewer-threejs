Web 3D model viewer

  > The app has two models that can be looked at.
      The first one is an eye that looks at the mouse's diraction, and the second one is a dinosaur head that can be moved around its axis.
      You can switch between them with the button at the bottom center of the screen.

  > There is a slite bug with the camera when switching between the models. 
      When you go to the second model "the dino head" if you do not return it to its original possition after rotating it around, you will change the camera view.
      That meens if you swich back to the eye model(the first one) the eye will appear to be in a different spot or even no be visible at all. 
      To try and fix this, I made it so the camera resets when you switch between models.
      So if you move the dino head around and then return to the eye model and you don't see it or it is in a different spot just click the "Change Model" button twice and the eye will appear again!
