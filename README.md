There is a slite bug with the camera when switching between the models. If you do not return the dino head to its original possition after rotating it around, you will change the camera view, that meens if you swich back to the eye model the eye will be in a different spot. To try and fix this I made it so the camera resets between models, by pressing the button again you will return to the dino head, if you don't touch it and press the button again the eye will be in it original spot.
